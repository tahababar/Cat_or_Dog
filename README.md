# Cat_or_Dog
iOS App Development Project


I created a machine learning model from scratch by collecting Training and Testing Data for cats and dogs. I used CreateML to create a CoreML model and then used it in Xcode using Swift to create an app that can access your photo library or camera to tell whether the pictures you captured are of dogs or cats.
